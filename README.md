## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I started with the HTML structure by creating a div to represent the card, i also added appropriate element within the content of the card. I added styles to the content elements within the card such as font, colour, size, layouts, borders. I ensured the layout adapts well to different screen sizes using media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries

### What I learned
I learnt more about border styling. I also mastered the act of using media queries to ensure my projects adapts well to different screen sizes.

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .container {
        background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
        margin: 150px auto;
        max-width: 100%;
        padding: 15px;
        border-radius: 20px 25px 20px 20px;
        border-left: 0.5px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
        border-bottom: 8px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
        border-right: 8px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
        border-top: 0.5px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
